# Observatory

Observatory is a flask app that observes and centralizes information about
Socorro development and deployment inside Mozilla.

## What now?

Observatory watches Github and deployed environments to figure out what is
deployed where.  It exposes this information through an API so it can be
consumed by other tools.
